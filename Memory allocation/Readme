Memory allocation simulator handles only three types of memory allocation algorithms
* First fit.
* Best fit.
* Worst fit.
The program allows the user to enter holes sizes in memory , the start address of each hole , any number of processes with the information of each process (id and size) and the simulator will allocate the processes in the holes according to the algorithm chosen.
It also allows the user to deallocate any process and allocate another one at run time
